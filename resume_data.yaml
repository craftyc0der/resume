about_me:
  - description: Experienced tech team leader. Full-stack site reliability engineer. IoT electronics designer.
  - description: Lifelong learner interested in solving hard problems. Manifesting new things into reality is my passion. My career has taught me that execution trumps ideas. Great things do not just happen. They are made by applying creativity, grit, and hard work.
  - description: My experience is in software, hardware, and their interface. I am equally comfortable designing a high performance compute cluster, a tiny circuit, or a mobile computing interface to bring the other two things together. Managing a network of human resources and applying their narrow talents to a complex problem is the path to success.
  - description: Voracious reader of history. Math nerd. Guitarist. Husband. Father. Entrepreneur.
